Every day with you feels like a beautiful dream come true. Your smile brightens my world, and your love fills my heart with indescribable joy. I cherish every moment we spend together and find myself falling deeper in love with you as time goes by.
Chintalli, you are my sunshine, my rock, and my best friend. I love you more than words can express, and I'm grateful for your presence in my life. You make everything better just by being you.
Forever yours, Sid")
